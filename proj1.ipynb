    "Let's figure out which restaurants had the lowest scores. Let's start by creating a new dataframe called `ins_named`. It should be exactly the same as `ins`, except that it should have the name and address of every business, as determined by the `bus` dataframe. \n",

    "*Hint*: Use the merge method to join the `ins` dataframe with the appropriate portion of the `bus` dataframe. See the official [documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/merging.html) on how to use `merge`.\n",

    "*Note*: For quick reference, a pandas 'left' join keeps the keys from the left frame, so if ins is the left frame, all the keys from ins are kept and if a set of these keys don't have matches in the other frame, the columns from the other frame for these \"unmatched\" key rows contains NaNs.\n",

    "Let's figure out which restaurants had the worst scores ever (single lowest score). Let's start by creating a new dataframe called `ins_named`. It should be exactly the same as ins, except that it should have the name and address of every business, as determined by the bus dataframe. If a `business_id` in ins does not exist in bus, the name and address should be given as `NaN`.\n",

Create a side-by-side boxplot that shows the distribution of these scores for each different risk category from 2017 to 2019. Use a figure size of at least 12 by 8.\n",

    "- **Passing** (1-3 points): A chart is produced but with some flaws such as bad encoding. The text written is incomplete but makes some sense.\n",
    "- **Unsatisfactory** (0 points): No chart is created, or a chart with completely wrong results.\n",

    "* a few visualizations; Please limit your visualizations to 5 plots.\n",
    "* a few sentences (not too long please!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that you will only receive support in OH and Piazza for Matplotlib and seaborn questions. However, you may use some other Python libraries to help you create you visualizations.
