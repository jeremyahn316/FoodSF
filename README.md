# FoodSF

This project was created as a part of Data 100: Principles and Techniques of Data Science using Python's Pandas and Jupyter Notebook. 

In this project, investigated restaurant food safety scores for restaurants in San Francisco. The scores and violation information have been made available by the San Francisco Department of Public Health. The main goal is to walk through the process of Data Cleaning and EDA.

As we clean and explore these data, main objective is to:

- Read simple csv files and using Pandas
- Work with data at different levels of granularity
- Identify the type of data collected, missing values, anomalies, etc.
- Explore characteristics and distributions of individual variables
